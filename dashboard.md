# Project Summary - Week 1

## Tasks Completed

### Karan, Milan:
- **Set up separate pages**: Completed basic pages for login, homepage, and deck management.
- **Frontend Setup**: Set up React and ensured smooth routing between pages using React Router.
- **Styling**: Applied CSS for layout and design, focusing on a simple yet clean UI.

### Ian, Liam:
- **Backend Setup**: Set up initial backend structure.
- **Database Integration**: Started working on the database model for decks.

## Progress Overview
We’re mostly on track with the initial setup for the project. We’ve finished setting up the main frontend pages and basic routing. There's still a lot of backend work left to connect everything and get data flow working.

- **What’s done**: 
  - Frontend pages (Login, Homepage, Deck creation) are set up.
  - Routing and basic page functionality are working.
  - Basic CSS design is in place.

- **What’s left**:
  - Backend integration for deck creation and management.
  - User authentication with database.
  - Testing and some minor UI tweaks.

## Process Thoughts
The process is going pretty well so far, but we need to start focusing more on backend/database functionality in the next sprint. We should probably get more into testing as well and make sure we’re testing individual features on separate branches before merging them.

### Next Steps:
- Set up more backend endpoints.
- Implement deck creation functionality.
- Continue testing features as they’re developed.

## Branches & Tasks Completed/Reviewed

- **Frontend Setup**: Completed the setup for the main pages and routing.
- **Styling**: Finished applying the CSS for basic layout and card design.
- **Login Flow**: (If applicable) Set up basic login functionality.

## Testing Report
- **What’s working**:
  - Basic pages are loading correctly.
  - Routing between pages is functioning as expected.
  - Basic layout and styling are applied correctly.

- **What’s not working**:
  - Backend functionality is not integrated yet (still in progress).
  - User login database needs to get connected.
  - Due to us only being on the final steps for the backend - frontend integration, we have not been able to implement any of our functionality tests quite yet
